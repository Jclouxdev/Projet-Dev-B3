## The project

### Description

The idea is to create a C2C Eshop.
The main inspiration is "Vinted". We want to create a powerfull filter system to search and categorises items.

Customers will have access to their account, create offers, answer offers, see and manage their offers.

Administrators will have access to every offers on the website, with the help of our search system.
Admin can delete or hide offers and manage users.

### Killer Features :

- Possibility to add categories in wishlist to receive (mail) notifications when new products with the rights descriptions are added to the shop.
- Great filter and search system fault-proof.

### Dream feature :

- Chat between the two customers
