## 🌱 The project

### GreenVault

GreenVault, first website for second hand.

### Description

The idea is to create a C2C Eshop.
The main inspiration is "Vinted". We want to create a powerfull filter system to search and categorise items.

Customers will have access to their account, create offers, answer offers, see and manage their offers.

Administrators will have access to every offers on the website, with the help of our search system.
Admin can delete or hide offers and manage users.

### Killer Features :

- Great filter and search system fault-proof.
- Admins & Users have access to stats to see the evolution of the quantity of offers by days...
